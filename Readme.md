# Memory Game Project

This project is a **Memory Game** created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It challenges the player to remember and replicate sequences of colors in increasing levels of difficulty. The primary focus of this project is on the JavaScript logic, which has been developed from scratch using core concepts like asynchronous programming, event handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation..

## Project Description
The game is built with a focus on user interaction, response accuracy, and step-by-step progression. The core logic of this game is designed using JavaScript, implemented with efficient and clean code to ensure seamless performance and user engagement..

**Important:** The HTML structure and CSS styles for this project have been adapted from various online sources, while the JavaScript logic is uniquely developed by me, ensuring originality and creative problem-solving.

### Key Features
- **Random Sequence Generation:** Displays a random sequence of colors that the player must remember.
- **Level Progression:** Increases the difficulty with each successful round.
- **Custom Sound Effects:** Uses sound files for better user interaction.
- **Game Over Handling:** Displays a message when the player fails to complete the sequence correctly..

## How to Play
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors flash on the screen.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the color buttons.
4. If you click the correct sequence, you move to the next level.
5. The game ends if you click the wrong color, and you have to restart from level 1.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for the structure of the web page.
- **CSS** for styling and design (adapted from online resources).
- **JavaScript** for game logic (written entirely from scratch).

## Credits
- **Sounds:** Sound files used in this project have been sourced from online sound libraries.
- **CSS and HTML:** The styling and structure are adapted from publicly available resources to suit the game design.
- **JavaScript Logic:** Developed entirely from scratch, using my own problem-solving skills and logic..
